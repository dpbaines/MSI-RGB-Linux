# MSI-RGB-Linux
A linux service to manage the RGB headers on MSI motherboards, giving more interactive control over the colour based on system information, or using configurable setups.

The RGB interfacing details are derived from https://github.com/nagisa/msi-rgb who wrote a similar tool a while ago.
